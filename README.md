# Haddop-Project
we are going to perform Image processing on Hadoop Cluster. Let’s take one real time scenario to elaborate the definition of this Project. On Social Media web Sites like Facebook, Twitter etc. have a number of users who share and upload pictures and videos. Sometime Image file with same name, same format, same resolution and same size is shared by multiple users all these Images are stored in the Data Base even though it carries a same properties. This doesn’t look good as duplicate files occupied needless space in File System.   What we are going to do is build an algorithm which is going delete all these duplicate files from Hadoop File System (HDFS).
